How to use KNXtoMQTT/AMQP:
Before the use of the “KNXtoMQTT/AMQP” application, the specified IoT broker need to run and the KNXnet/IP Gateway has to be reachable. After this the “KNXtoMQTTAMQP.config” file in the root Folder of the application has to be defined.
In order to use the application correctly, all parameters have to be filled in. At the moment, the application supports AMQP and MQTT for the IoT communication.
Furthermore, the connecting KNX System has to follow the tag_based_shema.xsd schema as explained in 3.4 and saved as knx_input_model.xml. After this, the “main” class can be executed.
